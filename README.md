# The GNL Tao Te Ching

**GNL's Not Lao**

*Version 2.07*

## Caveat

This document attempts to draw the texts of several popular English
translations of Lao Tse into a consistent and accessible context. It is
based on the translations of Robert G. Henricks, Lin Yutang, D.C. Lau,
Ch'u Ta-Kao, Gia-Fu Feng & Jane English, Richard Wilhelm and Aleister
Crowley.

This work is not a translation, but an interpolation. It does not
represent the original text; the original, if there was an original, has
been jumbled, mistranscribed and reinterpreted many times over many
thousands of years, and is here cast into a language that is incapable
of presenting its poetic structure and philological connections.

Even an original text, translated as faithfully as possible, might
remain inaccessible to the modern reader unable to place it within its
original context. The intention of this work is to construct a document
that closely corresponds with the best modern translations of Lao Tse, but
which is blunt, easy and useful to read within a modern context.
